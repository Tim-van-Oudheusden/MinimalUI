# Session summary

Hand-off notes for agent work in this repository, so the next session starts from where the last one stopped instead
of cold (AGENTS.md "Session Completion" step 7). Keep it short: overwrite the "Latest session" section at the end of
each session, in the issue's own commit; durable lessons belong in `.claude/memory/corrections.tsv`,
`docs/reflections/` or `bd remember`, not here.

Format: date, issue/PR worked, outcome, open follow-ups, gotchas for next time.

## Latest session

- **Date:** 2026-10-31
- **Worked:** #279 → `fix/279-robolectric-offline`. CI on `main` (run 41196461082, d1873d2) failed every Robolectric
  class: Robolectric's own `MavenArtifactFetcher` got a 404 (`FileNotFoundException`) for an android-all jar from Maven
  Central at test time. The same tree had passed on the PR, and the jar is on Maven Central, so the download was
  transient. Gradle now resolves the android-all jars (`robolectric-android-all` bundle in `libs.versions.toml`, one
  per SDK the tests use: 28 and 35), `:app:robolectricJars` copies them into `app/build/robolectric-jars`, and every
  app `Test` task runs Robolectric with `robolectric.offline=true` from there. Dependabot ignores
  `android-all-instrumented`: the versions follow the Robolectric release.
- **Outcome:** PR open, `Fixes #279`. It touches build scripts and this file, so it is high risk and the maintainer
  merges it.
- **Open follow-ups:** none.
- **Notes for next session:**
  - Podman may be missing on this host; then build on the host with `JAVA_HOME=~/tools/jdk` and
    `sdk.dir=/home/dev/tools/sdk` in `local.properties`. actionlint is not installed, and the host shellcheck is 0.9.0:
    fetch the pinned releases from `ci.yml` into `/tmp/bin`.
  - The host's `jq` is jaq 3.1.1, which rejects `$module`/`$label` as variable names, so 12 tests in
    `AutoQaTunerScriptTest`, `PrMetricsScriptTest` and `QualityReportScriptTest` fail locally on an unmodified `main`
    too; CI uses jq and passes. Put jq 1.7.1 (`jqlang/jq` release `jq-linux-amd64`) first on `PATH` to run them.
  - The emulator on this host segfaults with SwiftShader Vulkan; use `-gpu swangle_indirect`
    (`docs/reflections/2026-10-29-emulator-on-this-host.md`).
  - Sandbox Gradle in this checkout needs `--project-cache-dir /tmp/pcache`, otherwise Spotless trips over host paths
    left in `.gradle/`.
  - Managed-device runs locally: `podman run --rm --device /dev/kvm -v "$PWD":/workspace:z -w /workspace
    -v minimalui-sandbox-gradle:/root/.gradle localhost/minimalui-emu:dev2 ./gradlew :e2e:atdApi35DebugAndroidTest
    -Pandroid.testoptions.manageddevices.emulator.gpu=swangle_indirect`.
  - In the sandbox, Spotless can fail with `Could not read path '…/build/…'` when it runs alongside compilation in one
    `check`: run `spotlessCheck` on its own first, then `check assembleDebug -x spotlessCheck`.
  - The edit tools resolve relative paths against the main checkout, not a `worktrees/` checkout: a session that
    edits in a worktree must use its full path, or the edits land on whatever branch the main checkout has.
  - Robolectric runs offline from jars Gradle resolves (#279), so the sandbox no longer needs the host's `~/.m2`
    mounted for `:app:testDebugUnitTest`. A Robolectric upgrade needs the android-all versions it names: the build
    ids are string constants in `org/robolectric/plugins/DefaultSdkProvider.class` of the robolectric jar, the `iN`
    suffix in `DefaultSdkProvider$DefaultSdk.class`.
